    "\n",
    "* Model evaluation is the process of using different evaluation metrics to understand a machine learning modelâ€™s performance, as well as its strengths and weaknesses.\n",

    "#### Classification Accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is the simplest out of all the methods of evaluating the accuracy, and the most commonly used.\n",
    "* It is simply the number of correct predictions divided by all predictions or a ratio of correct predictions to total predictions.\n",
    "* While it can give you a quick idea of how your classifier is performing, it is best used when the number of observations/examples in each class is roughly equivalent.\n",

    "* The value for predictions runs from 1 to 0, with 1 being completely confident and 0 being no confidence.\n",

    "* This means that an AUC of 0.5 is basically as good as randomly guessing.\n",

    "* The report also returns prediction and f1-score.\n",
